PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This system has been developed to support an exam evaluation system. It contains information about the examiner, exam staff, secondary examiner, and copy details. With this information, we can carry out operations for exam evaluation, such as deciding how many copies will be checked and storing their details in the database. Once the assessment is completed, we can calculate the total bill for the examiner. The system also allows for the generation of reports, such as the pass/fail ratio, the average score, and the distribution of marks.

EXAMINER INFORMATION: In the first phase of our evaluation process, we gather all relevant information about the examiner who will be evaluating the copy. This includes the examiner's name, contact information, bank account details, and qualifications. All of this information is stored in our database and available during the evaluation process.

EXAM-STAFF INFORMATION: The Office Work Assignment operation assigns examiners to specific office tasks during examination time. These tasks include distributing copies of the examination paper for revaluation and providing other services to students. The system stores the examiner's availability for office work in a database and then assigns them to specific tasks.

B-PART EXAMINER: The B-part Examiner revaluates the examination copy repeatedly and notes marks on the index pages after each evaluation. The B-part Examiner continues this process until they are satisfied with the marks. They then sign the index pages to indicate that the review is complete.

COPY DETAILS: In this phase, we have collected all the information related to the copy bundle, including which institute or exam centre the copy came from. In addition, we have identified the student who submitted the copy, and the date and time of submission.

COPY-DISTRIBUTION DETAILS: This phase involves distributing copies of the examination paper to the examiner for revaluation. The information is then stored in a database. When calculating the bill, the examiner calculates the total copies and income earned from checking the copies. The examiner also calculates the total time spent on each copy and the total time spent on all copies.

BILLING SUMMARY: This phase contains the total income of the examiner, which is earned after evaluating the copy. The examiner's income is based on the number of copies assessed and the rate per copy. The phase also includes information about the date of the examiner's payment and the payment amount.
